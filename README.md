# LLM-model-for-SQL-Query-Transformation

This repository presents a mid-term project that involves leveraging ChatGPT to transform natural language queries into their equivalent SQL queries. The project utilizes a sample customer-product-order database in Access format, which is converted to Excel for table storage. A MySQL (or similar) database is created to enable querying via an API. The natural language queries cover various join operations (inner, outer, semi, and equi) and aggregate operations (such as sum and average).
